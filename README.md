"whenthebus" is a script which will access the MBTA transit APIs in
order to get a list of imminent buses at a set of local stops.  The
output is either plaintext or (minimally enhanced as) HTML.  Nothing
fancy, just the bare data.

See the top of the "whenthebus" script itself for more information.
